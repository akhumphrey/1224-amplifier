# Guitar Amplifiers

This repository contains the source files for the guitar amplifier projects I take on.

## The Amps

1. [1224](1224) - a 5F2-A style amplifier constructed from parts salvaged from a vintage [Philco model 1224](https://www.vintageradio.co.nz/model/philco/1224) tablegram.
1. [7vdw](7vdw) - a 6G2 style amplifier constructed from parts salvaged from the radio chassis portion of a vintage [Columbus model 7VDW](https://www.vintageradio.co.nz/model/columbus/7vdw) stereogram.

## References

I took a lot of learning and guidance from other circuits and the teaching of much more learned individuals while coming up with these designs. I stand upon the shoulders of giants, some of which are mentioned here in no particular order:
